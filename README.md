# C#-Advanced
The "C# Advanced" course builds on my skills in working with the C# language and the .NET platform by looking at more complex concepts typical of the language. In the course I learned to create linear data structures, solve algorithmic problems (problem solving skills), work with streams, files and directories, create template classes. Attention is paid to the functional programming paradigm, as well as to the main tool based on it - LINQ for data flow processing.
